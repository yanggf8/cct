## 🔄 **Dual Model Architecture Achievement**

### **From Backup to Active Partnership:**
- **Before**: N-HITS was merely a fallback when TFT failed
- **After**: TFT and N-HITS run as equal partners in parallel

### **Parallel Execution Implementation:**
```javascript
const [tftResult, nhitsResult] = await Promise.allSettled([
  getTFTPrediction(symbol, marketData.data, env),
  getNHITSPrediction(symbol, marketData.data, env)
]);
```

### **Intelligent Ensemble Logic:**
- **TFT Weight**: 55% (favored for complex pattern recognition)
- **N-HITS Weight**: 45% (excellent for trend continuation)
- **Consensus Bonus**: +10% confidence when models agree
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful single-model operation if one fails
