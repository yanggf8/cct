# 📱 Microsoft Teams Integration Setup Guide

## 🎯 Overview

Replace unreliable Facebook Messenger notifications with professional Microsoft Teams notifications for your trading system. Teams integration provides:
- ✅ **High Reliability** - Enterprise-grade Microsoft infrastructure
- ✅ **Rich Formatting** - Structured messages with actionable buttons
- ✅ **Mobile Friendly** - Works perfectly on Teams mobile app
- ✅ **Instant Delivery** - Real-time notifications
- ✅ **No API Limits** - Unlimited notifications
- ✅ **Professional Environment** - Business-focused communication

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### **Step 1: Create Teams Channel**
1. Open Microsoft Teams
2. Go to the team where you want notifications
3. Create a new channel (e.g., "📊 Trading Alerts" or "🤖 Trading System")
4. Click the three dots (•••) next to the channel name
5. Select **Connectors**

### **Step 2: Add Incoming Webhook**
1. In Connectors, search for **Incoming Webhook**
2. Click **Add** button next to "Incoming Webhook"
3. Click **Configure**
4. Provide a name (e.g., "Trading System Notifications")
5. Optionally upload an image (I recommend a chart/finance icon)
6. Click **Create**

### **Step 3: Copy Webhook URL**
1. After creating, Teams will show you the webhook URL
2. Copy the entire URL (it starts with `https://outlook.office.com/webhook/...`)
3. **Keep this secure** - it's like an API key for your Teams channel

### **Step 4: Add to GitHub Repository**
Using GitHub CLI (recommended):
```bash
gh secret set TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL --body "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE" --repo yanggf8/cct
```

Or manually:
1. Go to: `https://github.com/yanggf8/cct/settings/secrets/actions`
2. Click **New repository secret**
3. **Name**: `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL`
4. **Secret**: Paste your Teams webhook URL
5. Click **Add secret**

## ✅ That's It!

Your trading system will now send professional notifications to Microsoft Teams instead of Facebook Messenger.

- `💹 Market Alerts` - For market-moving updates
- `📈 Performance Tracking` - For daily/weekly results

### **Multiple Channels (Advanced)**
You can create multiple webhooks for different channels:
- Create separate webhook URLs for different teams/channels
- Add them as different secrets (e.g., `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL_TRADING`, `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL_ERRORS`)
- Modify the workflow to send different message types to different channels

### **Custom Notifications**
The Teams module supports:
- **Success messages** - Green theme, completion notifications
- **Error alerts** - Red theme, failure notifications
- **Custom themes** - Different colors for different message types
- **Rich formatting** - Links, bold text, emojis

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### **Webhook URL Security**
- Treat webhook URL like an API key
- Don't share it publicly
- Anyone with the URL can post to your channel
- Rotate webhook if it gets compromised

### **Message Content**
- No sensitive API keys in messages
- No personal data in notifications
- Only report links and system status
- All data is publicly accessible via URLs anyway

### **Access Control**
- Only channel members can see notifications
- Teams handles user permissions
- Enterprise-grade security from Microsoft
- GDPR compliant

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Messages Not Appearing**
1. **Check webhook URL**: Verify it's correctly set as GitHub secret
2. **Check Teams permissions**: Ensure you can post in the channel
3. **Check GitHub Actions**: Look at workflow logs for Teams notification errors
4. **Test manually**: Use curl to test webhook:
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"Test message from trading system"}' \
  YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL
```

### **Common Errors**
- **"Incoming webhook is disabled"**: Contact Teams admin to enable
- **"Invalid webhook URL"**: Check for typos or missing characters
- **"Channel not found"**: Verify webhook URL matches your channel

### **Performance**
- **Delivery time**: Usually under 1 second
- **Reliability**: 99.9%+ uptime from Microsoft
