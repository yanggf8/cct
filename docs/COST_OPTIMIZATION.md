## üîç Understanding Cloudflare Services

### **KV Storage vs Durable Objects**

#### **KV (Key-Value) Storage** - What we currently use
- **Purpose**: Global distributed key-value store
- **Best for**: High-read, low-write scenarios
- **Consistency**: Eventual (up to 60 seconds delay)
- **Use cases**: Configuration, static data, caching
- **Our usage**: Storing analysis results, reports, cache

#### **Durable Objects** - Proposed for monitoring
- **Purpose**: Stateful instances with strong consistency
- **Best for**: Real-time applications, ordered operations
- **Consistency**: Strong (same instance, ordered processing)
- **Unique feature**: Self-sustaining alarms (can wake themselves up)
- **Use cases**: Real-time monitoring, collaborative tools, stateful workflows

**Key Difference**: Durable Objects can set alarms to wake themselves up every 15 minutes. KV cannot do this - it's just storage.

## üí∏ Cloudflare Pricing Breakdown

### **Free Plan (Current)** - $0/month

| Service | Free Tier Limit |
|---------|-----------------|
| Workers Requests | 100,000/day |
| Workers CPU Time | 10ms per request |
| KV Reads | 100,000/day |
| KV Writes | 1,000/day |
| KV Deletes | 1,000/day |
| Cron Triggers | 3 cron jobs (limited frequency) |
| **Durable Objects** | ‚ùå Not available |

**Our Current Usage**: Well within free tier ‚úÖ

---

### **Paid Plan** - $5/month

| Service | Included in $5/month |
|---------|---------------------|
| Workers Requests | 10,000,000/month |
| Workers CPU Time | 50ms per request |
| KV Reads | 10,000,000/month |
| KV Writes | 1,000,000/month |
| KV Deletes | 1,000,000/month |
| **Durable Objects** | ‚úÖ Available |
| DO Requests | 1,000,000/month FREE |
| DO Duration | 400,000 GB-seconds FREE |

**Durable Objects for Our Use Case**:
```
Usage Calculation:
- 3 markets (VIX, SPY, DXY)
- 26 executions/day (every 15 min during market hours)
- 22 trading days/month
- 1 second execution time
- 128MB memory per object

Total Requests: 3 √ó 26 √ó 22 = 1,716/month
Total Duration: 1,716 seconds √ó 0.125 GB = 214.5 GB-seconds

Cost: $0 (well within free tier of paid plan!)
```

**Conclusion**: If we paid $5/month, Durable Objects usage would be FREE. We'd only pay the base $5.

## üÜì FREE Alternative Solution

### **Option: GitHub Actions Scheduler** (Recommended)

**How it works**:
1. GitHub Action runs every 15 minutes (cron schedule)
2. Action calls our Worker endpoint via HTTP
3. Worker fetches market data (VIX, yields, dollar)
4. Worker stores data in KV
5. Frontend reads from KV

**Cost**: $0 (GitHub Actions free for public repos, 2000 min/month for private)

---

### **Implementation**

#### **1. Create Worker Endpoint**

```typescript
// src/api/market-structure-update.ts
export async function handleMarketStructureUpdate(request: Request, env: Env) {
  // Verify secret header (security)
  const secret = request.headers.get('X-Scheduler-Secret');
  if (secret !== env.SCHEDULER_SECRET) {
    return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 });
  }

  // Fetch market structure data
  const vix = await fetchYahooFinance('^VIX');
  const yields = await fetchFREDData(['DGS10', 'DGS2']);
  const dollar = await fetchYahooFinance('DX-Y.NYB');

  // Store in KV
  await env.TRADING_RESULTS.put(
    'market_structure_latest',
    JSON.stringify({
      vix,
      yields,
      dollar,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    }),
    { expirationTtl: 1800 } // 30 min TTL
  );

  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ success: true }), {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  });
}
```

#### **2. Create GitHub Action**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/market-monitoring.yml
name: Market Structure Monitoring

on:
  schedule:
    # Run every 15 minutes during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
    # Cron runs in UTC, so adjust for ET (UTC-5 or UTC-4 during DST)
    - cron: '30,45 14,15,16,17,18,19,20 * * 1-5'  # Weekdays only
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allow manual trigger

jobs:
  update-market-data:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Fetch Market Structure Data
        run: |
          curl -X POST https://tft-trading-system.yanggf.workers.dev/api/market-structure-update \
            -H "X-Scheduler-Secret: ${{ secrets.SCHEDULER_SECRET }}" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Setup**:
1. Add GitHub Secret: `SCHEDULER_SECRET` (random string)
2. Add same secret to Worker environment: `SCHEDULER_SECRET`
3. Commit `.github/workflows/market-monitoring.yml`

---

### **Comparison: Durable Objects vs GitHub Actions**

| Aspect | Durable Objects ($5/month) | GitHub Actions ($0) |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **Cost** | $5/month base fee | $0 (free tier) |
| **Complexity** | Low (self-contained) | Medium (external service) |
| **Reliability** | Very High (Cloudflare native) | High (GitHub reliable) |
| **Setup** | Moderate (new concept) | Easy (standard CI/CD) |
| **Maintenance** | Low | Low |
| **Control** | Full (within Cloudflare) | Depends on GitHub |
| **Performance** | Excellent (edge network) | Good (external trigger) |
