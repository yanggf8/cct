# ðŸš€ Cloudflare Workers Neural Network Training

This directory contains training notebooks specifically designed for Cloudflare Workers compatibility.

## Files

### ðŸ““ Cloudflare_Workers_Neural_Network_Training.ipynb
**NEW:** Complete training notebook for Cloudflare Workers compatible models

**Features:**
- âœ… Pure JavaScript weight extraction
- âœ… Cloudflare Workers optimized architectures
- âœ… Direct weight-based inference implementation
- âœ… R2 storage deployment package
- âœ… Complete JavaScript inference code generation

**Output:**
- Genuine neural network weights in JavaScript-compatible format
- Complete inference implementation for Cloudflare Workers
- Deployment package ready for R2 upload

### ðŸ““ Neural_Network_Training.ipynb
**LEGACY:** Original TensorFlow.js training (incompatible with Workers runtime)

## Usage

### Option 1: New Cloudflare-Compatible Training
```bash
# 1. Open the new notebook in Google Colab
# 2. Run all cells to train Cloudflare-optimized models
# 3. Download the generated deployment package
# 4. Follow deployment guide to upload to R2 and deploy
```

### Option 2: Convert Existing Models
```bash
# Use the conversion utilities in the new notebook to convert
# existing TensorFlow.js models to Cloudflare Workers format
```

## Key Differences

| Feature | Legacy Training | New Cloudflare Training |
|---------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Output Format** | TensorFlow.js | JavaScript Weight Arrays |
| **Inference** | tf.loadLayersModel() | Pure JavaScript Implementation |
| **Compatibility** | Requires TF.js Runtime | Native Cloudflare Workers |
| **Performance** | External Library Overhead | Direct Weight Computation |
| **Deployment** | Complex TF.js Setup | Simple JavaScript Upload |

## Model Architecture

### TFT (Temporal Fusion Transformer)
- Variable selection network
- LSTM temporal processing
- Multi-head attention (simplified for Workers)
- Dense prediction layers

### N-HITS (Neural Hierarchical Interpolation)
- Multi-rate temporal decomposition
- Hierarchical feature combination
- Convolutional processing
- Dense prediction layers

## Deployment Pipeline

```
Training (Colab) â†’ Weight Extraction â†’ JavaScript Generation â†’ R2 Upload â†’ Worker Deployment
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run new training notebook** to generate Cloudflare-compatible models
2. **Upload weights to R2** using provided scripts
3. **Replace current models.js** with generated JavaScript inference
4. **Deploy and test** with genuine neural network inference

This approach provides **authentic neural network inference** without TensorFlow.js dependencies.
