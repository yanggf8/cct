# TFT Primary + N-HITS Backup ModelScope Requirements
# Optimized for cloud deployment with minimal dependencies

# Core ML Libraries
scikit-learn>=1.0.0
numpy>=1.21.0

# Optional: For enhanced TFT functionality
# torch>=1.9.0
# pytorch-lightning>=1.5.0

# Data Processing (Optional but recommended)
# pandas>=1.3.0

# Built-in Python Libraries (No installation needed)
# json
# datetime  
# pickle
# os
# warnings
# typing

# ModelScope Runtime Dependencies
# (Provided by ModelScope platform)
# requests
# flask
# gunicorn

# Additional Utilities (Optional)
# matplotlib>=3.5.0  # For visualization
# seaborn>=0.11.0    # For plotting

# Production Dependencies (Minimal Set)
# This minimal set ensures fast deployment and reliability:
# - scikit-learn: For Statistical TFT (GradientBoosting) 
# - numpy: For numerical computations and array operations

# Note: PyTorch is optional and will enable Neural TFT when available
# Without PyTorch, system uses Statistical TFT with same API interface
